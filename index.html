          A donation is a gift for charity, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a
          cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, alms,
          services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A
          donation may satisfy medical needs such as blood or organs for
          transplant.

        <h2>Our Donate Plan</h2>
        <p>
          Sylhet in Bangladesh has been hit with heavy flooding that has
          affected thousands of families. As the flood water recedes, families
          are returning home to find that their homes, belongings, and lives
          have been torn apart by this unforgiving natural disaster. Our present
          plan is to donate Sylhet's flood affected people.

            <h4>Food for a family</h4>
            <p>
              Food is vital to families in order for them to stay healthy while
              having the energy to continue fighting and rebuilding their lives.
              Your donations will provide them with enough food to sustain them,
              helping them to feel as though they have a chance of standing
              strong once again.

            <h4>Shelter for a family</h4>
            <p>
              As homes have been damaged and torn apart, families have nowhere
              to live but your donations can provide them with a basic shelter
              that keeps them safe and out of the rain. This will lift their
              spirits and help them to feel as though they have a home that they
              can rebuild from..

            <h4>Education for a child</h4>
            <p>
              There is no doubt that education is crucial to children and the
              way in which they develop. Along with this, they enhance their
              skills, learn new skills and set themselves up for life as an
              adult.
